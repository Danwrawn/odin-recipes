    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound uncooked spaghetti</li>
        <li>½ cup olive oil</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until 
            <br>cooked through but firm to the bite, about 10 to 12 minutes. Drain and transfer to a pasta bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the pasta is cooking, combine olive oil and garlic in a cold skillet. Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic, 
            <br>about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low when olive oil begins to bubble. Cook and stir until garlic is golden brown,
            <br>about another 5 minutes. Remove from heat.
        </li>
        <li>Stir red pepper flakes, salt, and black pepper into pasta. Pour in hot olive oil and garlic, and sprinkle on Italian 
            <br>parsley and half of the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese; toss until combined.</li>
        <li>
            Serve pasta topped with the remaining Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
        </li>
    </ol>
